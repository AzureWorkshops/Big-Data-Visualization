In this workshop, attendees will build an end-to-end solution to predict flight delays taking into account the weather forecast using Power BI, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, an Azure Machine Learning.
AdventureWorks Travel (AWT) provides concierge services for business travelers. In an increasingly crowded market, they are always looking for ways to differentiate themselves and provide added value to their corporate customers. 
They are looking to pilot a web app that their internal customer service agents can use to provide additional information useful to the traveler during the flight booking process. They want to enable their agents to enter in the flight information and produce a prediction as to whether the departing flight will encounter a 15-minute or longer delay, taking into account the weather forecasted for the departure hour.

**Time Estimate:** 5.0 hours
