## Azure
We need an active Azure subscription in order to perform this workshop.  There are a few ways to accomplish this.  If you already have an active Azure subscription, you can skip the remainder of this page.  Otherwise, you'll either need to use an Azure Pass or create a trial account.  The instructions for both are below.

## Azure Pass
If you've been provided with a voucher, formally known as an Azure Pass, then you can use that to create a subscription.  In order to use the Azure Pass, direct your browser to [https://www.microsoftazurepass.com](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com) and, following the prompts, use the code provided to create your subscription.

Congratulations!  You've now created an Azure tenant and subscription!
